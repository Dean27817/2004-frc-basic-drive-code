# 2004-frc-basic-drive-code
code that I have written as a basic CIM drivetrain using victor motor controllers and 2004 frc hardware.

I have been able to find almost no documentation online about these old systems. It makes sense because, as of writing this, these systems are 20 years old, but I enjoy working with older tech and was able to get my hands on a few of these old systems.
