**HARDWARE:**/<br>
the necessary hardware is the innovation first robot controller, operator interface, and serial cables to connect everything. you also need something to control, such as motor controllers. the controller works over PWM, so a lot of RC hardware will work. The era-appropriate hardware is CIM motors and VICTOR 884  speed controllers, as well as innovation-first SPIKE relays. 

it is suggested to get joysticks that work over serial, as well as the radios from 2004 to 2008 (there are two different radios, but as far as I know they work the same). finally, it would be helpful to get some way to power everything, such as the PDH from the era, but a more modern one would work too.

**SOFTWARE:**<br>
This repo has the example code given on the team 358 website and the programs that you need to compile and upload. a lot of these programs were only able to be found by searching the websites through the wayback machine and going to 2004 - 2007. I have gotten the code to compile, but have not yet gotten the code to deploy.
