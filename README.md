# 2004-frc-basic-drive-code
code that I have written as a basic CIM drivetrain using Victor motor controllers and 2004 FRC hardware.

I have been able to find almost no documentation online about these old systems. It makes sense because, as of writing this, these systems are 20 years old, but I enjoy working with older tech and was able to get my hands on a few of these old systems.


Update!

I was able to find some docs from team 358 on their website (https://www.team358.org/files/programming/ControlSystem2004-2008/). I'm not sure if I am allowed to put the PDF docs here, but you can find them on the website above. 

hardware:
the necessary hardware is the innovation first robot controller, operator interface, and serial cables to connect everything. you also need something to control, such as motor controllers. the controller works over PWM, so a lot of RC hardware will work. The era-appropriate hardware is CIM motors and VICTOR 884  speed controllers, as well as innovation-first SPIKE relays. 

it is suggested to get joysticks that work over serial, as well as the radios from 2004 to 2008 (there are two different radios, but as far as I know they work the same). finally, it would be helpful to get some way to power everything, such as the PDH from the era, but a more modern one would work too.
